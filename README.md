# CGM-Forecasting-Robustness-and-Safety
This repo is the result of my thesis "Enhancements in CGM Forecasting: Robustness Against Domain Shifts and Safer Predictions". It analyzes and improves the robustness against domain shifts and the clinical safety of predictions made by state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in CGM forecasting.
